## Acknowledgements

This App won't be possible without the base npm package signature_pad: https://www.npmjs.com/package/signature_pad. You can refer the package documentation to know more about the package and various options it offers.

## Notes
My current App is an implementation for React JS Apps with the redo functionality missing in original package.
